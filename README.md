# Salesforce DX Babashka Example Project

This project was created using the command `https://github.com/nextdoc/salesforce-babashka-sample.git` 

Then a bb.edn file was added to provide DX scripting using tasks from https://github.com/nextdoc/salesforce-babashka

# How to use this?

You will need to install Babashka https://book.babashka.org/#_installation

You can either:
1. clone this repo
2. copy the bb.edn from here into your own repo 

Once you have a bb.edn file, you can try `bb tasks` to see what is available
